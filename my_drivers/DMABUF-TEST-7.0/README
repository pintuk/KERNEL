DMABUF : Buffer Sharing Mechanism : A sample kernel module
==========================================================
This contains a sample utility for verifying DMABUF buffer sharing in kernel space using 2 sample drivers.
The folder contains 2 sample kernel drivers : exporterA and importerB.
The exporterA is the exporter of the buffer. Here the buffer is allocated using CMA techniques.
The importerB is one of the user of the buffer created by exporterA.
