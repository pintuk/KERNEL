Description:
------------
This hexcopy is a driver that takes input as binary file and 
create a hex file as output.
The driver name is: hexcopy

Compile:
--------
To compile the driver for x86:
# make

To compile the driver for ARM:
# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-
Also, for ARM you need to set the correct kernel source path

Test:
-----
To test the driver, follow these steps:
a) Install the driver:
# sudo insmod hexcopydrv.ko
This will install the driver in /dev
The driver path will be: /dev/hexcopy

b) Create an image file using dd command:
# dd if=/dev/urandom of=image2.bin bs=1M count=1

c) To execute the test, do this:
# cat image2.bin > /dev/hexcopy
This will create the hex output file: /tmp/output

d) Another way to test is, using dd command:
# dd if=image.bin of=/dev/hexcopy bs=<file size in bytes> count=1

If we compare the output with hexdump command, both output will be exactly same.
This driver is tested on both x86 and ARM with atmost 1MB of image file.
